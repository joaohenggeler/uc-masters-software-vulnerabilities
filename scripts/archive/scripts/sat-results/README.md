# SAT Results

This directory is meant to store any files that were generated by SATs (Cppcheck, Flawfinder, etc) and that will be imported into the database using the `add-sat-results.py` script.

For example:
* `cppcheck-analysis.xlsx` 
* `flawfinder-1-f40f923a0a09ab1d0e28a308364a924893c5fd02-1.csv`
